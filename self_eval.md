# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
# It's useful to use a conditional in your code when you want to write any lines of code with "conditions," such as "and" and "or" and whatnot. 

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
# I've learned to use `&&` instead of `and`...they yield different results and so I was confused for a second, but now I know the difference.

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
# I just appreciated how I understood almost all of the work thoroughly the first time I ran through it, and it was really nice being able to troubleshoot the errors I made, whether they be process or syntax errors.
